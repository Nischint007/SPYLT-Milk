🥛 SPYLT Milk — A Bold Frontend Clone with Smooth Scroll and GSAP Magic

A clean, high-fidelity clone of the SPYLT Milk website, fully rebuilt using GSAP, Lenis.js, and Vanilla JavaScript — bringing scroll-based storytelling and rich interaction design to life with hand-coded precision.

🎨 About the Project

SPYLT Milk is a beautifully abstract, scroll-driven creative website known for its dark aesthetic, large typography, and subtle motion. Originally built as a design-forward experience, it inspired me to take up the challenge of recreating it entirely from scratch — without any frameworks, templates, or builders — just raw code and my frontend skills.

To bring this clone to life, I used:

⚡ Vanilla JavaScript  
🌀 GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)  
🧵 Lenis.js for smooth scrolling  
💅 Custom HTML5 & CSS3  

This project demonstrates my ability to reverse-engineer modern creative websites and rebuild them into pixel-perfect, performant experiences — all while maintaining fluid scroll animations, subtle transitions, and responsive design.

✨ Key Highlights  
🔁 Scroll-based GSAP timelines crafted from scratch  
🔧 Responsive design work in progress
🎯 Micro-interactions and hover effects tailored to match original behavior  
🛠️ Zero frameworks, 100% handcrafted code  

Rebuilding the SPYLT Milk website helped me sharpen my animation precision, improve my timing control with GSAP, and push myself creatively as a frontend developer. It stands as a proud addition to my portfolio — and a tribute to the original creators’ beautiful vision.
